3. What cookies, transparent GIFs, and log files are and how we use them.
Most popular Web sites, including VERBED, interact with your Web browser to store small text files, or “cookies”, on your computer’s hard drive. Some sites use pixels, or transparent GIF files, to help manage their online advertising. We may use either or both. Like most Web sites, we use our servers to create log files of site data. This includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks. We use the data in log files to analyze trends, administer the site, track users’ movements in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.

When you visit our site, unless you are specifically informed otherwise, we are the only ones collecting information about you. We may pay third-party servers to process the data on our behalf.
We may from time to time run promotions that may be sponsored or cosponsored by other companies. Some or all of the information collected on our site during a promotion may be shared with the sponsor. If that is the case, you will be notified prior to providing your information. Based on that notification, you may, of course, elect to decline participation in the promotion.When you click on third-party links on our site, they may direct you away from our site. Those sites are not operated by VERBED and are therefore not under our control. Their privacy practices may or may not be consistent with our practices. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites and encourage you to read their privacy statements.

In the event that we go through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of our assets, your personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. You will be notified by a prominent notice on our Web site and an email prior to a change of ownership or control of your personal information.
